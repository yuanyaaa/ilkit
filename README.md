**Status**: Under development, and there may be some bugs. Welcome to issues, bug reports and PRs!

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BepfCp/ilkit
cd ilkit
# install with D4RL
pip install -e ".[d4rl]"

## Run Experiments

### Train RL or IL agent

```bash
# RL
python example/train_agent.py agent=rl/ppo env.id=Hopper-v4

# IL
python example/train_agent.py agent=il/gail env.id=Hopper-v4 expert_dataset.d4rl_env_id=hopper-expert-v2
```

By default, the results are stored at the `logs` dir.

### Collect demonstrations

```bash
python example/collect_demo.py agent=rl/sac env.id=Hopper-v4 model_path=data/hopper-v4_sac.pt
```

### Hyper-parameter Fine-Tuning

We support to use [nni](https://github.com/microsoft/nni) to auto-tune hyperparameters. To do so, please specify your `nni_optim_fn` function in `example/hyper_param_tuning.py`.

```bash
pip install nni
# start to fine tune hyper parameters
nnictl create -c conf/nni_cfg.yaml -p 8080

# stop to fine tune hyper parameters
nnictl stop --all
nnictl stop [experiment ID]
nnictl stop [port]

# view experiment
nnictl view [--port PORT] [--experiment_dir EXPERIMENT_DIR] id
```

Then, watch the results at `http://localhost:8080`; if you want to stop the experiment, please use command `nnictl stop [Experiment ID]`. For more commands, please see [the official documentation](https://nni.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/nnictl.html).

## TODO

- [x] Support nni
- [ ] Support the `__target__` usage of Hydra
- [ ] Support parallel sampling
- [ ] Support Ray for distributional training
